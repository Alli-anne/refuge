            <h2>About The App</h2>
            <p>Refuge's mission is to inspire and sustain a deeper, more consistent engagement with scripture among Christians of all ages by transforming personal study into an interactive, meaningful, and community-centered experience. We aim to provide a peaceful and uplifting digital space where users can overcome motivation and time barriers to their faith journey, allowing them to record personal insights, reflect on spiritual growth, and share encouragement with a positive community, ultimately strengthening their personal relationship with God through the power of His word.
Refuge exists to help Christians grow closer to God each day by making scripture study more intentional, uplifting, and connected. We believe that every person’s spiritual insights are valuable — both to themselves and to others who are striving to deepen their faith. Our mission is to provide a peaceful, Christ-centered space where believers can record personal revelation, reflect on their spiritual journey, and share encouragement within a supportive community. By combining meaningful journaling with the opportunity to connect through God’s word, Refuge inspires consistent study habits and strengthens unity among disciples. We are committed to helping every user rediscover joy in daily scripture study and to “share their light” in a world that needs more hope and truth.
